    "You need to generate an array of noise vectors. However, now is also a good time to talk about the batch size. Recall that the truncation factor is used to generate the noise, but it's also an input to the model itself. Even though, the goal is to generate 50 images, the model is using the same truncation factor for all images generated in a single batch. This means that to generate images for 10 different truncation factors, you will need to evaluate the model with 10 separate batches. In summary, you need 10 batches with 5 noise vectors in each batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use a different random seed to generate the noise vectors for every batch. Otherwise, the noise vectors will be similar between batches, and you won't see enough diversity in the images to make conclusions. Also, use the truncation threshold of 5 to get some low-probability noise vectors into the batch.\n",
